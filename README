This library allows you to leverage the Postmark REST API to send emails.

It is adapted from https://github.com/bitformed/postmark-java to include mavenification 
and support for the Spring Framework.

For now only SimpleMailMessage and MailSender are supported, but this can be easily 
extended to support JavaMailSender and MimeMailMessage (with attachments). This work
may be performed in the future, depending on my needs. 

Otherwise, feel free to improve the library ;)

If you use maven, this project is hosted at
